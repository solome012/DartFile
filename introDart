Key feature of Dart include: 
1) Object-oriented 
2) Strongly typed: Dart is statically typed langauge , meaning that variable types are declared explicity at compile time.This helps catch type- related errors early in the development process 

3) Cross-platform Support :

5) Open Source: 

Due to its association with the flutter framework, dart has gained significant popularity among developers interested in cross- platform mobile app development , as it allows them to build gigh performance and visually appealing aplications with a single codebase that runs on both ios and android devices. However , Dart can also be used independently for other types of application and projects.
