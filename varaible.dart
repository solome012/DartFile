/*Here’s an example of creating a variable and initializing it:

var name = 'Bob';
Variables store references. The variable called name contains
 a reference to a String object with a value of “Bob”.

The type of the name variable is inferred to be String, but you can 
change that type by specifying it. If an object isn’t restricted to 
a single type, specify the Object type (or dynamic if necessary).

Object name = 'Bob';
Another option is to explicitly declare the type that would be inferred:

String name = 'Bob';
